# Forms

We use forms to collect user input. The input is then sent to a server for processing.

We use forms everywhere, for example:
- paper forms 
- sign in forms (email & password)
- sign up forms (first name, last name, ...)
- web shops (select a payment method)

## The `form` Element

A container for different types of input elements.

## The `input` Element

The input element accepts and stores user input.

Since we can input many different data types, we have different types of inputs:
- Text fields (single line, multiline, passwords)
- Number inputs ()
- Radio buttons
- Checkboxes
- Dropdowns
- Date pickers
- File inputs
- Submit buttons
- and many others

## The `label` Element

We use them to define a label for many form elements.

We need to bind `input` elements together with their corresponding `input` elements. We do that by setting the `label`'s `for` attribute value the same as the `input`'s `id` element.

Remember, `id`s are unique across the whole web page
