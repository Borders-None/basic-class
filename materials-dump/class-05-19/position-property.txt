First, let's talk again about cascade and inheritance: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Cascade_and_inheritance

CSS position property:
    - default value is static

Elements are positioned if the value of their position property is not static

Relative positioning
    - moves elements around relative to where they would normally appear in the static flow of the page

We move the element by defining left, right, top, bottom values
    - negative values can also be used

Absolute positioning
    - “Absolute positioning” is just like relative positioning, but the offset is relative to the entire browser window instead of the original position of the element
    - It completely removes an element from the normal flow of the page
    - Coordinates for absolute elements are always relative to the closest container that is a positioned element


Fixed positioning
    - similar to absolute positioning
    - fixed elements don't scroll with the rest of the page

Sticky positioning:
    - a mix of relative and fixed: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position
