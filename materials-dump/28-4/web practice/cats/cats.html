        The <b>cat</b> (<i>Felis catus</i>) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal.
        It is the only domesticated species in the family <i>Felidae</i> and is often referred to as
        the <b>domestic cat</b> to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.

        A cat can either be a <b>house cat</b>, a <b>farm cat</b> or a <b>feral cat</b>;
        the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact. Domestic cats are valued by humans for
        companionship and their ability to kill rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.
