- classes
    - I can have multiple elements with the same class
-ids
    - Only ONE element with the ids

- We can write CSS that is more specific than other CSS
    - With the combination of:
        - classes, nested selectors, and IDS


1. Find all selectors that apply to the element
2. Find the selector(s) with the highest specificity
3. If there is only 1 selector with the highest specificity
    - This is the selector that is going to apply its styling
4. Else 
    - Pick the selector that is the lowest in the CSS file
