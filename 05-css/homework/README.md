# Homework

* For practice try to make list (ordered or unordered) with some background. After that try to make a couple of list items, add different classes to them, and then use class selectors to apply different colors to them (you can try change text color and background color).

* Try to make two paragraphs show next to each other in column. For content you can use [lorem ipsum text](https://www.lipsum.com/). 

Hint: *You will have to use inline-block display on paragraphs, and you will have to change width of both paragraphs so they fit one next to the other*
