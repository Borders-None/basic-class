# Responsive design

Responsive web design (RWD) is a web design approach to make web pages that render well on all screen sizes and resolutions while ensuring good usability.

HTML is fundamentally responsive, or fluid. If you create a web page containing only HTML, with no CSS, and resize the window, the browser will automatically reflow the text to fit the viewport.

While the default responsive behavior may sound like no solution is needed, long lines of text displayed full screen on a wide monitor can be difficult to read. If wide screen line length is reduced with CSS, such as by creating columns or adding significant padding, the site may look squashed for the user who narrows their browser window or opens the site on a mobile device.

Creating a non-resizable web page by setting a fixed width doesn't work either; that leads to scroll bars on narrow devices and too much empty space on wide screens.

Responsive web design isn't a separate technology â€” it is an approach. It is a term used to describe a set of best practices used to create a layout that can respond to any device being used to view the content.

Modern CSS layout methods are inherently responsive, and we have a multitude of features built into the web platform to make designing responsive sites easier.

## Media Queries

Media queries allow us to run a series of tests (e.g. whether the user's screen is greater than a certain width, or a certain resolution) and apply CSS selectively to style the page appropriately for the user's needs.

For example, the following media query tests to see if the current web page is being displayed as screen media (therefore not a printed document) and the viewport is at least 80rem wide. The CSS for the .container selector will only be applied if these two things are true.

``` css
@media screen and (min-width: 80rem) {
    .container {
        margin: 1em 2em;
    }
}
```

You can add multiple media queries within a stylesheet, tweaking your whole layout or parts of it to best suit the various screen sizes. The points at which a media query is introduced, and the layout changed, are known as **breakpoints**.

A common approach when using Media Queries is to create a simple single-column layout for narrow-screen devices (e.g. mobile phones), then check for wider screens and implement a multiple-column layout when you know that you have enough screen width to handle it. Designing for mobile first is known as **mobile first design**.

If using breakpoints, best practices encourage defining media query breakpoints with **relative units** rather than absolute sizes of an individual device.

Media queries can help with RWD, but are not a requirement. Flexible grids, relative units, and minimum and maximum unit values can be used without queries.

## Responsive layout technologies

 Flexbox, and Grid are responsive by default. They all assume that you are trying to create a flexible grid and give you easier ways to do so.

 ### Flexbox

 In Flexbox, flex items shrink or grow, distributing space between the items according to the space in their container. By changing the values for `flex-grow` and `flex-shrink` you can indicate how you want the items to behave when they encounter more or less space around them.

 There is also `flex-wrap` that we talked about in class.

 In the example below the flex items will each take an equal amount of space in the flex container, using the shorthand of flex: 1

 ```css
.container {
    display: flex;
}

.item {
    flex: 1;
}
 ```

 ### CSS grid

 In CSS Grid Layout the `fr` unit allows the distribution of available space across grid tracks. The next example creates a grid container with three tracks sized at `1fr`

 ```css
.container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
}
 ```

 ## Responsive images

 To ensure media is never larger than its responsive container, the following approach can be used:

 ```css
img,
picture,
video {
    max-width: 100%;
}
 ```


This scales media to ensure they never overflow their containers. Using a single large image and scaling it down to fit small devices wastes bandwidth by downloading images larger than what is needed.

Responsive Images, using the `<picture>` element and the `<img>` `srcset` and `sizes` attributes enables serving images targeted to the user's viewport and the device's resolution. For example, you can include a square image for mobile, but show the same scene as a landscape image on desktop.

## Responsive typography

Responsive typography describes changing font sizes within media queries or using viewport units to reflect lesser or greater amounts of screen real estate.

### Using media queries for responsive typography

In this example, we want to set our level 1 heading to be 4rem, meaning it will be four times our base font size. That's a really large heading! We only want this jumbo heading on larger screen sizes, therefore we first create a smaller heading then use media queries to overwrite it with the larger size if we know that the user has a screen size of at least 1200px.

```css
html {
  font-size: 1em;
}

h1 {
  font-size: 2rem;
}

@media (min-width: 1200px) {
  h1 {
    font-size: 4rem;
  }
}
```

As this approach to typography shows, you do not need to restrict media queries to only changing the layout of the page. They can be used to tweak any element to make it more usable or attractive at alternate screen sizes.

### Using viewport units for responsive typography

Viewport units vw can also be used to enable responsive typography, without the need for setting breakpoints with media queries. `1vw` is equal to one percent of the viewport width, meaning that if you set your font size using `vw`, it will always relate to the size of the viewport.

```css
h1 {
  font-size: 6vw;
}
```

The problem with doing the above is that the user loses the ability to zoom any text set using the `vw` unit, as that text is always related to the size of the viewport. **Therefore you should never set text using viewport units alone.**

There is a solution, and it involves using `calc()`. If you add the `vw` unit to a value set using a fixed size such as `ems` or `rems` then the text will still be zoomable. Essentially, the `vw` unit adds on top of that zoomed value:

```css
h1 {
  font-size: calc(1.5rem + 3vw);
}
```

This means that we only need to specify the font size for the heading once, rather than set it up for mobile and redefine it in the media queries. The font then gradually increases as you increase the size of the viewport.
