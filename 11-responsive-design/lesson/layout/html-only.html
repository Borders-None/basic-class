    <p>While the default responsive behavior may sound like no solution is needed, long lines of text displayed full
        screen on a wide monitor can be difficult to read. If wide screen line length is reduced with CSS, such as by
        creating columns or adding significant padding, the site may look squashed for the user who narrows their
        browser window or opens the site on a mobile device.</p>
