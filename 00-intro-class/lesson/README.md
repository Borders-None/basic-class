# Introduction class

Welcome to the Borders:none basic class. Today we will get to know each other and share important information about the class.

## Let's get to know each other

Everybody please give a short introduction about themselves:
- your name
- your experience with programming
- what do you do in your free time 
- (for non-students) what is your role in this class

## About the basic class

The aim of this class is to teach you to create **static websites** by using **HTML** and **CSS**. Static websites are websites that display stable content meaning every user sees the same thing. A good example website of a static website might be a CV website because the content displayed there does not change very often and every user that visits your CV website sees the same stuff.

HTML and CSS are languages that we use to create websites. A language in programming is pretty similar to normal languages like English. Every language you want to speak or write in has certain rules you need to follow so another person can understand you. The only difference is that HTML and CSS are some of the many languages a computer uses and if we want it to understands us, we better learn them. 

Let's take a look at a website on the Internet and see what it is made of.

While even static websites can use **JavaScript**, another programming language, we are not teach it in this class but during the **advanced course** where the focus is on **dynamic websites, programming logic, algorithms, data structures, ...**.

## Classes

Mondays and Thursdays from 18h until 20h at the Helsinki Committee (Ul. kneza Domagoja 16, 10000)

During each class, we talk about topics regarding HTML and CSS.

We will do exercises together during the class where you can play around with the new knowledge and ask us to help you if anything is unclear.

### Homeworks

After each class or topic, you will be given some homework that is needed for you to solve and upload before each class. We do that to validate that you are actually following the class and keeping up with new topics. 

Homeworks are **MANDATORY**

Before the next class, you are required to upload your homework so the teachers can check it and see how well you understood the thought topic. That way, we are also forcing you to study and work on these topics even outside of classes which is **crucial** if you aim to be good enough to land a **frontend developer job**.

#### Homework Sessions

During the last semesters, we held homework sessions where students would be able to get together and do the homework together by helping each other. Is this something you would like to have?

### The final project

At the end of the classes, you will get a final project to apply the knowledge gained from this class in creating a website.

Also, we are thinking about letting you pick a website you wish to work on from the beginning of the class and gradually add more and more features to it.

We will share more info about that soon.

## Pre-class workshops

Benyamin will every Monday, from 17h until 18h (before class on Monday) have a session with you on various topics like: maths, problem solving etc.
